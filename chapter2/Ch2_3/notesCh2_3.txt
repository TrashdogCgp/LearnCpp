Void functions, non value returning functions

To tell a compiler that a function does not return a value, a return type of void is used.

A function that does not return a value is called a non-value returning function (or a void function)

A void function does not require a return statement. However, a return statement (with no return value) can be used in a void function.
Such a statement will return the function to the caller at the point where the return statement is executed. This same thing would happen at the end of the function anyway.

Best practice: Do not put a return statement at the end of a non-value returning function.

Void functions can't be used in expressions that require a value.
e.g. std::cout << voidFunction(); //compile error, no value provided

Quiz
1. Inspect the programs and state what the output, or whether they will not compile.

a) prints out:
A
B

b) (code omitted) Will not compile because the function attempts to use a void function's return value (or lack thereof) as an operand.
