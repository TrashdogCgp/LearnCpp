How to design your first programs

Super important thing to remember is to design the program before you start coding.
Step 1: Define your goal
Step 2: Define requirements
Step 3: Define tools, targets, and backup plan
Step 4: Break hard problems down into easy problems
Step 5: Figure out the sequence of events

Honestly, reading through this, but not taking notes due to the sheer tedium of trying to type all of this out.
Trying to explain problem solving is... verbose, for sure.

Text goes into top-down vs bottom-up
For top-down, start with a goal and break out subtasks.
For bottom-up, list tasks and construct hierarchy from there.

When implementing:
Step 1: Outline your main function with commented out function placeholders.
Step 2: Implement each function (define function prototype, write function, test function)
Step 3: Final testing

Advice:
Keep programs simple to start.
Add features over time.
Focus on one area at a time.
Test each piece of code as you go.
Don't invest in perfecting early code.
Optimize for maintainability over performance.
