Chapter 7 Summary and Quiz

1. Fix the program
Alter the if statement into an if block:
	if (num < 0)
    {
		std::cout << "Negative number entered.  Making positive.\n";
		num = -num;
    }

2. Write a file called constants.h that makes the following program run.
If your compiler is C++ capable, use inline constexpr variables. Otherwise, use normal constexpr variables.
max_class_size should be 35.

see ch7_x_2_main.cpp and constants.h

3. Write a function int accumulate(int x).
This function should return the sum of all the values of x that have been passed to this function.
see ch7_x_3.cpp

3b. What are two shortcomings of the accumulate() function above?
Well...
There's no way to reset the accumulated value.
And the one I didn't get offhand; there's no way to have multiple accumulators running.

Cool. Not gonna lie, I thought this quiz was going to be harder and I was kind of hoping to be chewed out on not having a deeper pedantic understanding.
