Question #1

Write definitions for the following. Use CTAD where possible (13.12 -- Class template argument deduction (CTAD) and deduction guides).

a) A std::vector initialized with the first 6 even numbers.

b) A constant std::vector initialized with the values 1.2, 3.4, 5.6, and 7.8.

c) A constant std::vector of std::string_view initialized with the names “Alex”, “Brad”, “Charles”, and “Dave”.

d) A std::vector with the single element value 12.

e) A std::vector with 12 int elements, initialized to the default values.


2. 
Let’s say you’re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, and arrows.

a)
Define an unscoped enum in a namespace to identify the different types of items. Define an std::vector to store the number of each item type the player is carrying. The player should start with 1 health potion, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Assert to make sure the array has the correct number of initializers.

b)
Modify your program from the prior step so it now outputs:

You have 1 health potion
You have 5 torches
You have 10 arrows
You have 16 total items
Use a loop to print out the number of items and the item names for each inventory item. Handle proper pluralization of the names.

3. Write a function that takes a std::vector, returns a std::pair containing the indices of the elements with the min and max values in the array. The documentation for std::pair can be found here. Call the function on the following two vectors:

see ch16_x_3.cpp

4.
Modify the prior program so that the user can enter as many integers as they like. Stop accepting input when the user enters -1.

Print the vector and find the min and max elements.
see ch16_x_4.cpp
