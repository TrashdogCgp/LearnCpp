Still getting through chapter 0, just like the other day.
It's pretty uneventful, but for the sake of comprehensiveness, I'm going in order to the best of my ability.
It shouldn't take much longer to get through this, and I'm taking notes as much as I can stand to.
Chapter 1 will probably also be a little on the dry side.
Still, I might learn a thing or two, and it'll bring me peace of mind.
