Ran into more trouble than expected getting VSCode to actually see multiple cpp files with a header file included.
Except it turned out to be a mismatched curly brace, so that... was a lot of time spent trying to figure out what I needed to know for makefiles.
Still want to get good with makefiles, will probably take a detour at some point and spend a day on that.

Chapter 2 overall was mostly just another exercise in making sure VSCode would recognize multiple files when building.
I almost certainly need to work with makefiles to avoid relying on the IDE voodoo.
