Things to do when time permits:

*Enable word wrap by default in VSCode
*Set defaults for tasks.json to include compiler version, warning levels, etc (see notesCh0.txt)
*Set default settings, since it would only open in read-only mode prior
*Make sure constexpr use sinks in! Figure out whether or not to use consteval all over the place.
