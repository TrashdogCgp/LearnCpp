Started off with the lesson on literals, which explained a bit about C strings being weird.
Null-termination is mentioned, but the tutorial hasn't gone on with what makes them problems.
They did mention that string literals are guaranteed to exist through the whole program, though.
And that string literals are created at the start of the program.

Decided it's probably a better idea to go rename the folders rather than the note txt files.
This will give me the ability to look back at my notes and actually know which lesson I'm looking at.
Kinda embarrassed that I didn't consider that to start. URGH.

As of getting home from work and putting in a few more lessons, wow.
constexpr/consteval are some pretty dense reading.
The conditions for enforcing compile-time compilation are kind of wacky. 
I think I'll need to read through that again in the future, or just try to use constexpr/consteval and see whether or not the std::is_constant_evaluated() indications and/or compiler errors can help me understand better.
