Started off with the lesson on literals, which explained a bit about C strings being weird.
Null-termination is mentioned, but the tutorial hasn't gone on with what makes them problems.
They did mention that string literals are guaranteed to exist through the whole program, though.
And that string literals are created at the start of the program.
