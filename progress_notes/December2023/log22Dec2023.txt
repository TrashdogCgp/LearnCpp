Hate to admit it, but I'm not feeling especially with it today.
Going to get some really good sleep tonight and hope to be totally on the ball tomorrow.
Covered for loops today so far, doing break and continue, probably also at least doing halts.
If I still have the stamina for it, I'll do intro to testing your code.
Would really like to be done with chapter 8 tomorrow. Chapter 10 sounds like a much better way to spend the weekend.

However, FINALLY got around to adding wordwrap on by default in settings.json.
The embarrassingly simple secret here is that defaults won't let me edit, but user settings will let me add stuff that overrides those defaults.
Not gonna lie, that was a little frustrating.
