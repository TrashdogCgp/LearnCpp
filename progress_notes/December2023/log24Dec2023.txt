Started off today with the random number sections of chapter 8 and WHEW, that was some long, dry reading.
Going to work out, then do the chapter 8 quiz, then spend today pushing as far into chapter 10 as possible (note that chapter 9 is under construction as a split-up of chapter 8, since chapter 8 is such a freaking mammoth).
