Started chapter 4 on fundamental data types.
Less time to code today due to workout.

Mainly learned not to mix signed and unsigned integers, and that void is considered an incomplete type.
Incomplete types can't be instantiated.

Also, C++ only defines a minimum size for given types, not an actual size.
Implementation is allowed to choose the actual byte size for types, as long as it meets minimum.
