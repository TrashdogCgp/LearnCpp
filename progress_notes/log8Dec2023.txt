Going over variable assignment and initialization to start today.
This is basic, but I have to admit I don't know the terms as well as I should; list initialization is obvious enough, and I remembered direct, but copy list initialization has remained fuzzy and out of my thoughts until now.
Need to memorize those and be able to type out all six from memory--

default init (int x;)
copy init (int x=0;)
direct init (int x(0);)
direct list init (int x{0};)
copy list init (int x = {0};)
value init (int x{};)

Would like to make sure I can type that out on command, so I'll try to think about it just before I sleep tonight and make sure that's in my head.
