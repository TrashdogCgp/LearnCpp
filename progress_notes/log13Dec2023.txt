Note: in launch.json, I set stopAtEntry back to false because the debugging was starting to get annoying.
Starting the morning off with an oh-so-welcome Xfinity internet outage, but using my phone to pull up the pages.
Start with if statements, nothing new there so far.

Unreal. I start at 4:15 am and the text doesn't come until 1 PM that the internet came back up.
I was at work pretty much the whole time, but hot damn.
Got through chapter 4, did the quiz at the end.
The quizzes have promised to step up in difficulty, so I'm looking forward to that. Double I have time to get through all of chapter 5 at this point, though.
