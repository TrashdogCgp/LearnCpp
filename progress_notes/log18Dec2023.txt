No idea how I don't have a log for yesterday.
Got through a bit of chapter 7, but got distracted by something else that's also a priority.
Could've probably taken on most of chapter 7 yesterday and wrapped up this morning, but given that I got a fair amount done, no real regrets here.

Today, starting off by finishing variable shadowing and going over internal and external linkage.
