No idea how I don't have a log for yesterday.
Got through a bit of chapter 7, but got distracted by something else that's also a priority.
Could've probably taken on most of chapter 7 yesterday and wrapped up this morning, but given that I got a fair amount done, no real regrets here.

Today, starting off by finishing variable shadowing and going over internal and external linkage.

In the evening, got through two lessons on globals.
Still seriously need to understand constexpr more thoroughly, and got a refresher on how inline is used to indicate that something (variables) can be defined more than once, as long as those definitions are identical.
More time for this tomorrow; had an obligation early in the evening that prevented me from getting the full evening to study.
