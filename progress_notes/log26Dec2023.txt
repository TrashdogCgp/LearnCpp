Can't believe how freaking long chapter 10 is.
Every time I think I'll make headway, there's a section that has me put 200 lines of raw notes into the txt file for just that one lesson.

Completed the chapter 10 lectures, but not enough time tonight to do the quiz.
Doesn't look too bad, but I worry that I didn't quite grasp this stuff as solidly as I'd want to.
Hopefully, it'll all get reinforced over time, but I don't think I can just recall/memorize everything here without spending an unacceptable amount of time reviewing and quizzing myself on a bunch of chapters.
