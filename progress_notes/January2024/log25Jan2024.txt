Been a while since I actually did a daily log.
Should be clear that I've been at least putting in my hour a day, but I've been feeling kind of under the weather and low on energy for pretty much the whole month of January, especially in the past week or so.
I took a four-day break from working out, which is kind of a big deal for me, and I've been forcing my hour of coding just before bed because it's so freaking hard to muster up energy when it's not blocking me from getting some rest.
Speaking of rest, I've been sleeping 9 hours a night and that's cut into my time for other things, too. It's obnoxious to lose so much time just trying to feel okay again. I hope that whatever has been kicking my butt for these past few weeks, it resolves quickly.
I worked out again today, and hope to continue to have enough energy to do a workout every day from here on out. We'll see if I feel like it killed me tomorrow.
Anyway, I'm on chapter 21, but have a bunch of quizzes to make up, including finishing chapter 17 via its rather long quiz.
Hoping to do that over the weekend, but I expect to still be a bit busy. Doesn't help that work has been a bit wild lately, and I come home feeling drained sometimes.
Anyway, I'll keep going and hope to tackle the missing quizzes this weekend.
Hope this ages well...
