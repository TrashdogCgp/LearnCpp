Honestly just really down today.
Rough day at work and not near enough time in the morning to actually study before the day started.
Feels like I'm getting nowhere on this C++ stuff. I'm low-energy, feel like I don't have time, feel like I'm getting out of shape, feel like I'm failing at work, and can't shake a strong sadness. Got called out for being obviously autistic at work today and even though it wasn't meant in a malicious way, it stings that it's so damn obvious.
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just inconveniencing everyone and should just stop talking and stop trying to make friends. I wish I were strong enough or technical enough to compensate for how difficult and awkward I probably am.
I won't give up and won't break my resolution to do this hour of coding every day, because that's just how I'm wired. But it hurts more than usual this time, doubly so when I feel I should have an easier time with the coding quiz sections than I do.
