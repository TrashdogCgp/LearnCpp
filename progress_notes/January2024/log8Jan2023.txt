Another late start and another low-energy day.
Haven't been sleeping well for a while here and not sure why.

Today is range-based for loops (for-each) and array indexing and length using enums.
More if I have time, but we'll see.

Yeah, made time to at least go over vector resizing and capacity.
There might be enough time tomorrow to even finish the chapter, but I bet the quiz will take an hour on its own, this late into the series.
Going to do what I can. I'm probably making my current exhaustion worse with this attitude, but I continue to hold out hope that I'll be hit with a second wind of energy any day now.
