Not sure how I missed making a log yesterday, but I guess these things happen.

Started the chapter on std::vector and have made two days of relatively slow progress. This is an informative topic, though! 

I think I agree with the verdict that the tutorial put out. Choosing to make indexes unsigned was the wrong decision.
Not too much to say other than that the at() member function for vector seems just about useless and I'll just have to keep static casting ints to index adequately.
Blegh.
