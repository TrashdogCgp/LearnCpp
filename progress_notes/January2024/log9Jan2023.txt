Another late start today.

Got started on the ch16 quiz, but there definitely isn't enough time tonight to finish the whole thing.

It seems I'll also have to start actually doing a bit of data analytics for work. This... is fine, I guess, but I seem to have made the impression of someone who knows what they're talking about, and I don't intend to let my total inexperience and ignorance ruin that.
So I'll likely be slowing down a bit on the C++ studies, even from my current reduced pace, and starting another repo pertaining to Python data science studies. 
I'm still expecting to spend some time on C++ every day, but it might only be 30-45 minutes with the rest of my time spent on Python.
I'm not happy about that, but it might just have to be like that for a while.

Time will tell. Meanwhile, finishing chapter 16 tomorrow.
