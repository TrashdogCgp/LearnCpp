Chapter 15 starts today. We'll see if I can finish it today, too, despite a late start and surprisingly bad sleep.
Topic is just "more on classes", starting with the this pointer and going on to destructors, friend classes, and static member variables.

I definitely need to go back and look at some things.
Under what circumstances is a const qualifier dropped?
When do we need CTAD and how do we use templates without having to define a deduction guide?
