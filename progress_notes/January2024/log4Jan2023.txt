Another long day, another late start.
Should finish chapter 15 tonight. Only the section on ref qualifiers left, and the quiz.
If that doesn't take me an hour, I start on chapter 16. Topic is dynamic arrays(std::vector).
Getting frustrated by how many other things are on my mind now that work has resumed, but my resolve won't break.
One hour minimum, every day, for the rest of the year. Continuing to log my progress here until I've finished the entire learncpp compilation.
