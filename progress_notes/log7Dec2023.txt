Finishing chapter 0 and moving on through as much of chapter 1 as I can.
I want this stuff out of the way, but refuse to skip things.
I've browsed the stuff from chapter 18 on, and it looks much more interesting.
Going to try to stay motivated, and ensure that I stay focused, until then.

After reading the rest of it, the most impactful part of ch0 was actually VSCode settings.
Adjusting a project manually wasn't that bad, but I'm not sure how to set defaults for tasks.json, and that might become important as I go through the rest of these lessons.
Had to set language standard in compiler flags, set warning levels, and set compiler to treat warnings as errors. Also had to disable compiler extensions in that same json file.
Worth figuring out where/how the default is set!
