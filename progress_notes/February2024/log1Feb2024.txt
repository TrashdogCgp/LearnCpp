Seems I'm stuck in what might be considered exceptional circumstances pretty often at this point.
Today, I'm having company arrive pretty late in the night.
Rather than try to progress on lessons and hope things stick, this will be a review. I'll do my hour by looking back at past lessons and reinforcing:
Pass/return by reference
Lambdas
std::string_view behavior
std::cin invalid input handling
Type deduction via auto and for functions
