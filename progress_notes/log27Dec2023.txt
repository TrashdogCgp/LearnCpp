Starting off by doing the chapter 10 quiz.
Next up will be references and pointers. Pretty sure I've beaten that dead horse to death, but I'll be happy to learn something new all the same.
Skimmed the chapter 10 quiz last night before bed, so this shouldn't be too bad... unless I overestimated my power or something, but would I do that? Come on. From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

Wow. Somehow actually finished chapter 12 today. All of it.
Pointers and references complete, but that knocked out my entire day and now, at almost 9 PM, I'm kind of concerned that 12_14 didn't sink in as well as it needed to because of how badly I just want to get to sleep.

Still, had no difficulty with the quiz. Might want to brush up on how const and ref are dropped from type deduction, and how they're reapplied. The nuances probably would stump me if someone decided to try out a big nasty gotcha.
