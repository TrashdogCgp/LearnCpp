Started off with fixed-width integers in 4_6 and that was actually pretty interesting!
Didn't know about fast and least types before, too bad they're generally better off avoided.

The background for size_t (return type of sizeof, and represents the maximum size for an object created on the system) is actually kinda trippy as well.
Also weird that they limit the size of objects to half of the size_t maximum, as allegedly clarified in this rather long StackOverflow post:

More on this when I come back from work, I hope.

Floating point numbers now!

This allegedly makes clear how floating numbers are stored.
Unfortunately, while I'm still putting in my minimum of an hour after work today, my head is actually starting to spin a bit and I'm not processing well.
Looks like what it shows... is that a double starts with a sign, then shows exponent, then dedicates a lot of bits to significand (raw number to apply to exponent).
Site is actually pretty cool and shows evaluation in base 10, with a 2^n exponent and a significand that's very... long.
Worth looking back at if things get fuzzy in the future!

Also an approachable floating point guide here:

Look at this if the opportunity presents itself; not doing that tonight, I regret to admit.

Note the term "output manipulator".
Don't forget this; you know what it is, but don't forget it on straight-up recall.
