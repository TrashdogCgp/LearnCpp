Syntax and semantic errors

This chapter is about finding and removing bugs in our C++ programs, including learning how to use the integrated debugger in the IDE.

Common error categories: syntax error and semantic error (logic mistakes).

A syntax error occurs when your statement is not valid by C++ language grammar.
A semantic error occus when a statement is syntactically valid, but doesn't do what the programmer intended.

In most cases, compilers won't catch semantic errors because compilers are designed to enforce grammar, not intent.
