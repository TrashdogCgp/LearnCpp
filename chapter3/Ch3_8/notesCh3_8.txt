Using an integrated debugger: Watching variables

Stepping through the program is only half of what makes the debugger useful.
The debugger also lets you examine values of variables as you step through.

In VSCode, the watch window appears in debug mode, docked on the left above the call stack.
The watch window is a window where you can add variables you would like to continually inspect.
These variables will be updated as you step through your program.
If the watch window isn't already on your screen when you enter debug mode, you can bring it up through your IDE's window commands (typically View or Debug menu)

There are usually two different ways to add variables to the watch window:
Pull up the watch window and type in the name of the variable you'd like to watch in the leftmost column of the watch window
or
In the code window, right click on the variable you'd like to watch, and choose Add Watch or Watch [variable name].

Some debuggers will allow you to set a breakpoint on a watched variable rather than a line.

The watch window will also allow you to evaluate simple expressions, like x + 2.

Because inspecting values of local variables inside a function is common while debugging, many debuggers will offer some way to quickly watch all local variables in scope.
in VSCode, this is in the VARIABLES section that's docked to the left in debug mode.
