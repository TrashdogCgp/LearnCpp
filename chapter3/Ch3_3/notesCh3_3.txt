A strategy for debugging

Most of the work is finding, not fixing, the error.
So how do you find errors?

Code inspection
In many cases, especially in smaller programs, we can see the issue pretty quickly.
However, as programs get more complex, finding issues by code inspection gets more difficult, too.

Running the program
Figure out how to reproduce the problem, run the program and gather info to narrow down where the problem is.
We'll discuss techniques in this chapter to facilitate this approach.

Reproducing the problem is the most important step in finding the problem. This means making the problem consistently appear.
Reproduction steps are a list of clear and precise steps that can be followed to cause an issue to recur with high predictability.
100% reproducability isn't necessary, but higher is better.

We'll start with approaches for making guesses at where problems are in the next chapter.
