The debugging process

Bugs stem from a simple premise: Something you thought was correct, isn't.
Figuring out why/where can be challenging.
Note that the techniques for debugging are meant to be used with larger, more complex programs than what we've had exposure to so far.
The approaches outlined will seem like overkill.

Approach:
Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that’s not working)
Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring
Determine how you’ll fix the issue
Repair the issue causing the problem
Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed and no new problems have emerged
