Overloading operators using normal functions

Using a friend function to overload an operator is convenient for direct access to the internal members of classes you're operating on.
However, if you don't need that access, you can write overloaded operators as normal functions.
Because the normal and friend functions work almost identically (just with different levels of access), we generally won't differentiate them.
The one difference is that the friend function declaration inside the class also serves as a prototype.
With the normal function version, you'll have to provide your own function prototype.
In general, a normal function should be preferred over a friend function if it's possible to do so with the existing member functions available. The fewer functions modifying a class's internals, the better.
However, don't add additional access functions just to overload an operator as a normal function instead of a friend function.

Best practice: Prefer overloading operators as normal functions instead of friends if it's possible to do so without adding additional functions.
