1.2
Comments

Summary first.
At the library, program, or function level, use comments to describe WHAT.
Inside the library, program, or function, use commends to describe HOW.
At the statement level, use comments to describe WHY.

Single-line and multi-line comments exist and are things.
This much we've known for some time.

Comments should be used for three things: what, how, and why.
At the statement level, don't try to tell what code is doing; if it's complicated enough to need a comment explaining what it's doing, you probably need to rewrite the statement, not comment it.

Not much more to this lesson other than demonstrating how comments work.
