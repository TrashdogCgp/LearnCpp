Because chapter 8 pertains to a bunch of language features that don't actually have all that much depth, I'm not going into as much detail as usual.
There are tons of chapters left, and I'd rather spend my time on them than trying to type out the behavior of while and do while loops.
As much as I prefer thoroughness and pedantic understanding of what's going on and why, I think this is the first chapter where I just don't feel it's worth straining my hands.
I'll note what seems noteworthy, but there are just too many lectures in this chapter and I feel confident in saying I know most of what's coming.
Apologies if this disappoints anyone, in case anyone is paying attention.
