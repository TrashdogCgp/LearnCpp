If statements and blocks

The first category of control flow statements is conditional statements.
A conditional statement is a statement that specifies whether some associated statement(s) should be executed or not.

C++ supports two basic kinds of conditionals: if statements and switch statements.

If statements can execute compound statements (block), and this tends to be a more reliable way of getting intended results compared to just putting a single statement on the line after the if condition.

Best practice: Consider putting single statements associated with an if or else in blocks (particularly while learning). More experienced devs sometimes disregard this in favor of tighter vertical spacing.

A middle-ground approach is to put single-lines on the same line as the if or else.
e.g.
if (age >= minDrinkingAge) purchaseBeer();

When the programmer does not declare a block in the statement portion of an if statement or else statement, the compiler will implicitly declare one.
This, the following are equivalent:
if(condition)
    true_statement();
and
if(condition) {true_statement()};
