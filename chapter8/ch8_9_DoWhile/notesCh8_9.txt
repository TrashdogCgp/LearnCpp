Do while statements

A do while statement is a looping construct that works like a while loop, except the statement always executes at least once.
After the statement has been executed, the do-while loop checks the condition; if it's true, the path of execution jumps back to the top of the do-while loop and executes it again.

This can help avoid magic numbers and additional variables.
Worth discussing is that variables that evaluate the condition must be declared outside of the do block.

In practice, do-while loops aren't common. Having the condition at the bottom of the loop obscures the loop condition, which can lead to errors. Many developers recommend avoiding do-while loops altogether as a result.
Best practice: Favor while loops over do-while when given an equal choice.
