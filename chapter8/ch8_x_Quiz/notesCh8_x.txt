1. Modify the chapter 4 program with the ball falling off a tower so that the ball falls for as many seconds as needed until it reaches the ground.


2. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is evenly divisible by only 1 and itself.
Write isPrime() using a for-loop.



3. Implement a game of hi-lo. First, your program should pick a random integer between 1 and 100. The user is given 7 tries to guess the number.

If the user does not guess the correct number, the program should tell them whether they guessed too high or too low. If the user guesses the right number, the program should tell them they won. If they run out of guesses, the program should tell them they lost, and what the correct number is. At the end of the game, the user should be asked if they want to play again. If the user doesn’t enter ‘y’ or ‘n’, ask them again.

For this quiz, assume the user enters a valid number.

see Ch8_x_3.cpp, but honestly, this is extremely sloppy, the main function is too large, and the functionality is not modular as it should be.
Going to use Ch8_x_4.cpp to clean up from there.





4. Update your previous solution to handle invalid guesses (e.g. 'x'), out of bounds guesses, or valid guesses with extra characters. Also handle the user entering extra characters when the game asks them to play again.

see Ch8_x_4.cpp
